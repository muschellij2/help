The goal of help is to allow people to post issues on this repository for answering questions.

## Boilerplate email

Here is the email I send usually due to the high level of requests.

```
Dear Potential Collaborator,

Thank you for your email, sorry for a boilerplate response.  I receive a lot of questions about R and how to do X in R.  I am happy to answer questions, but need to protect my time.  

Many times, these correspondences take over 2 responses to resolve correctly, which can take upwards of 1 hour of my time (2.5% FTE of a 40 hr workweek).  Thus, I cannot respond to all of these for free.  Please indicate if you have effort to give for this consultation/collaboration.

I am happy to help, but before I do, please indicate (in an email):

1) Which websites (including > 2 links) you have visited that have not resolved your question.
2) Which students (> 1) you have contacted which may be able to help/collaborate so that they may be able to get on a paper given their help.
3) What timeframe you require help so that I can indicate if this is feasible.

Please post your question opening an issue on https://github.com/muschellij2/help/issues.

This is so that:
1) I can keep track of help (for my promotion/service).
2) I can point to examples for others if general.
3) Code is formatted easily.


Best, 
John
